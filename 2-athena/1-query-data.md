1. From the Query Editor tab, select your "ticketdata” database if not selected already.

2. Click the table named "parquet_sporting_event_ticket" to inspect the fields.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The type for fields id, sporting_event_id and ticketholder_id should be double

    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="2-athena/img/6.png"/></div>

    Next, we will query across tables parquet_sporting_event, parquet_sport_team, and parquet_sport location.

8. Copy the following SQL syntax into the New Query 1 tab and click Run Query.

    ```sql
    SELECT
        e.id AS event_id,
        e.sport_type_name AS sport,
        e.start_date_time AS event_date_time,
        h.name AS home_team,
        a.name AS away_team,
        l.name AS location,
        l.city
    FROM parquet_sporting_event e,
        parquet_sport_team h,
        parquet_sport_team a,
        parquet_sport_location l
    WHERE
        e.home_team_id = h.id
        AND e.away_team_id = a.id
        AND e.location_id = l.id;
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If Run query button is not enabled, select the entire query and press Control + Enter to have it executed. This may happen in some browsers due to bug in this part of the web console. You can also re-load the page.

    The results appear beneath the query window.

        parquet_person p
    WHERE 
        t.sporting_event_id = e.event_id
        AND t.ticketholder_id = p.id
    ```

        count(distinct location) as locations,
        count(distinct event_id) as events,
        count(*) as tickets,
        avg(ticket_price) as avg_ticket_price
    FROM td_sporting_event_ticket_info
    GROUP BY 1

    The purpose of saving the queries is to have clear distinction between the results of the queries running on one view. Otherwise, your query results will be saved under “Unsaved” folder within the S3 bucket location provided to Athena to store query results. Please navigate to S3 bucket to observe these changes, as shown below:
