Let’s see how we can add a bit of forecasting in our dashboard. Forecasting works with timeseries, which is better represented with a line graph. Let’s first create a line graph. 

1.	Click Add Visual at the top left corner of screen, and select Line Chart and add the event_date_time as the x-axis and aggregate by week. As shown in below screenshot:

You can go ahead and change the font and text to match what you would like it to say. Go to customize Narrative from the 3 dots … on the menu of the right of the visual and update it.
